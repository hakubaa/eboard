RFC 2045 - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One:

If a Content-Transfer-Encoding header field appears as part of a
message header, it applies to the entire body of that message.  If a
Content-Transfer-Encoding header field appears as part of an entity's
headers, it applies only to the body of that entity.  If an entity is
of type "multipart" the Content-Transfer-Encoding is not permitted to
have any value other than "7bit", "8bit" or "binary".  Even more
severe restrictions apply to some subtypes of the "message" type.

Certain Content-Transfer-Encoding values may only be used on certain
media types.  In particular, it is EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN to use any
encodings other than "7bit", "8bit", or "binary" with any composite
media type, i.e. one that recursively includes other Content-Type
fields.  Currently the only composite media types are "multipart" and
"message".  All encodings that are desired for bodies of type
multipart or message must be done at the innermost level, by encoding
the actual body that needs to be encoded.

Any entity with an unrecognized Content-Transfer-Encoding must be
treated as if it has a Content-Type of "application/octet-stream",
regardless of what the Content-Type header field actually says.
