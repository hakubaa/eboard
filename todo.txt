E-Mail Client:
- read e-mails
- add loger to ImapClient (save in database method calls and returned statuses)
- response client (mailbox list to select list above e-mails, hide date, 
                   hide checkbox, star)
- threads (imap extension)
- sending e-mails
- working version on ie (iframe issue)
- add search functionality

- delete email forever
- email and 
- refactor e-mailslistcontroller

DONE:
- add pages
- decode mailboxes labels (utf-7)
- change mailbox
- mark current mailbox
- mark not read message with different color 
    - add FLAGS: FLAGS BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS (DATE FROM)]
- dragable emails (between mailboxes)
- replace add_flags with store (in views), add parameter command (add, set etc.)
- add checklist with ["ALL", "READ", "UNREAD"]
- add button to create new message
- set as unseen / remove mailbox
- add buttons to select emails and remove them (just like in gmail)
- sort e-mail by date, but only the emails shown in current view 
    (imap by default doesn't enable to sort emails, there is
    an imap extension which has this functionality but it's not required to 
    be implmented by service providers (e.g. gmail))
