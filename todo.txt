E-Board:

E-Mail Client:
- sending e-mails
- delete email forever
- add info what is going on as message in top of the screen
- hide mailbox list (when user select one)
- improve tesks (responsive list, info when click)

NEXT TO DO:
- attachments
    - store attachments in database, identified by e-mail uid, show user
      list of attachments and links for downloading

DONE (BUT TO IMPROVE):
- read e-mails
- working version on ie (iframe issue)

DONE:
- add pages
- decode mailboxes labels (utf-7)
- change mailbox
- mark current mailbox
- mark not read message with different color 
    - add FLAGS: FLAGS BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS (DATE FROM)]
- dragable emails (between mailboxes)
- replace add_flags with store (in views), add parameter command (add, set etc.)
- add checklist with ["ALL", "READ", "UNREAD"]
- add button to create new message
- set as unseen / remove mailbox
- add buttons to select emails and remove them (just like in gmail)
- sort e-mail by date, but only the emails shown in current view 
    (imap by default doesn't enable to sort emails, there is
    an imap extension which has this functionality but it's not required to 
    be implmented by service providers (e.g. gmail))
- refactor e-mailslistcontroller
- response client (mailbox list to select list above e-mails, hide date, 
                   hide checkbox, star)
- add search functionality
- finish search functionality (main input and button)
- update emails list when moving mails
- database issue in deployment:
    - use environment variable OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR to change directory where
      db is created

WILL NOT BE DONE:
- threads (imap extension)
- add loger to ImapClient (save in database method calls and returned statuses)
